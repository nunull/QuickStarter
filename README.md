### How to use Quickstarter

To start the Program, simply run the Quickstarter.jar file using Java and the Program will open. This of course requires Java installed on your computer. By using the global shortcut you can access it whenever you need it by pressing CRTL+SPACE. Remember that the Program always react on that combination even if not intended. To close the Program just right-click on the icon located in your miniature icons and click ‘close’.

Using Quickstarter is very easy. Whenever you need it press CRTL+SPACE to access the Program. You will see a grey text-field, where you can type keywords to use the different modules. Each module reacts on different keywords. After the keyword you can type some additional information for the module. Some modules don’t require a keyword, they will react when they recognize a useable information. When you are typing all reacting modules will show up in al list below. If you see the module you want to use, select it using your arrow keys and press enter.

For example: You need to use Wikipedia to look up the article ‘Quickstarter’. Press CRTL+SPACE to access the Program. You can now start typing in the keyword for the Wikipedia module, which is ‘wiki’. In the list below there will be a couple of modules including ‘Wikipedia search’ after a space you can now type in the article you want to search for, in this case ‘Quickstarter’. The list should update and you should find ‘Wikipedia search for Quickstarter’ in the list. Now use your arrow keys to select it and your standard internet-browser opens the Wikipedia article ‘Quickstarter’. If there is no article called ‘Quickstarter’ on Wikipedia you will be directed to the search page of Wikipedia with ‘Quckstarter’ typed in as search-tag.

### List of Modules

#### Google-search

This module will always show up because there is no keyword for the Google-search- module. Using it will open your internet-browser with a Google-search for whatever you typed in. Example: typing in ‘Quickstarter’ and using the Google-search-module will show you all the Google search results for ‘Quickstarter’.

#### Web-search

This module has multiple different keywords because this module covers multiple websites. This module works the same as the Google-search-module with the only difference that you need to use a keyword. Sites covered are: Wikipedia, Google-maps, Youtube.

#### Local file search

Another module without a keyword. This module locates the file searched on your Computer.

#### Weather

By typing in ‘Weather’, the module replies the weather for the default city. You can also look up the weather for another city, by adding the city as additional information. There is no need to select the module, the information about the weather is shown in the list.

#### Calculator

This module doesn’t have a keyword but it will only react if you type in a mathematical term. It will show the result of the term in the list, you don’t need to activate it. You can also type in the function for a graph. You will find ‘draw’ in the list. Activating it will open a window showing the graph.

#### Translator

This module reacts on the keyword ‘translate’. It will output the translation of the word typed in after ‘translate’. You can set the Language you want to translate from and the language you want to translate into, before the word you want to translate. Example: ‘translate en de tree’. The default translation languages are from English to your system language. By activating the module your browser will be opened on the Google- translator page with the translated word already typed in.
